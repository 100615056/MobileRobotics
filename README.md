Creating an autonomous system using the turtleBot3 Waffle Pi and ROS.

## Milestone 1 (https://angelicacusipag.wixsite.com/mechatronics/videos?wix-vod-video-id=fba0de106d1045358d3286a39579b44a&wix-vod-comp-id=comp-keugdvfv1)

- The turtleBot3 Waffle Pi autonomously drives in the lane of the track

## Milestone 2 (https://angelicacusipag.wixsite.com/mechatronics/videos?wix-vod-video-id=af309fad0b8d4139952d46d24607416f&wix-vod-comp-id=comp-keugdvfv1)

- The turtleBot3 Waffle Pi autonomously drives along the track and be able to detect stop signs along the way and perform the appropriate response; stop and go after a time delay.

## Milestone 3 (No video demonstration due to cancellation of in-person class)

- The turttleBot3 Waffle Pi must autonomously drive along the track and be able to determine that an obstacle is in its pathway and move past it accordingly.
